            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </note> that ſome doe ſuppoſe, that Chriſt Ieſus, as a LAVV-GIVER, hath inſtituted a certaine POLICIE in his Goſpel, and decreed Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, which euery man ought neceſſarily to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and obey: vpon which ſandie foundation the whole frame and building of the Presbyterian Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is founded. But whence this new and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent falſe-Poſition is drawne, no man can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that hath but ſuperficially read ouer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Canons of the Councell of Trent.

This they doe, after the example of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who fained that GOD ſent CHRIST into the world, to propound a perfecter Law, than <hi>Moſes</hi> did. Yet Chriſt himſelfe (<hi>out of the Prophecie of Eſay, cap.</hi> 61. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.) teacheth vs, that he is
<pb facs="tcp:177506:3"/>ſent, to <hi>Preach the</hi> GOSPEL <hi>vnto the poore (Luc.</hi> 4.18.) Now to
<note n="*" place="margin">Evangelizare.</note> Preach the Goſpell, that is, to bring glad tidings, is not, to propound new Lawes. And albeit (<hi>in Matth. cap.</hi> 5.) Chriſt interpreted and expounded certaine Precepts, yet thereby he did not make, or deliuer vs any new Law; but onely vindicated the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> from the corrupt and falſe gloſſes of the Phariſies, and reſtored it to the former perfection. That we ought to obey Chriſt according vnto the Precepts of the Decalogue, which <hi>Moſes</hi> deliuered, no ſober man euer denied: but this is it, that wee conſtantly diſavow and gain-ſay, to wit, that CHRIST is a LAVV GIVER; or that the Goſpell, which is the glad tidings concerning ſpirituall and eternall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, hath ordained any new corporeal Policie.

But let them know, that the Diſcipline and Gouernement of the Church, is committed to other artificers, not vnto them; and
<pb facs="tcp:177506:5"/>let them remember that vſuall precept, that euery man adorne his owne boate.</p>
                  <p>Euen as,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Ariſtophanes his Cleon.</note> in <hi>Ariſtophanes, Cleon</hi> is ſaid, to haue one foote in the Court, and another in the Tents: So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, there are many reſtleſſe <hi>Cleons,</hi> who haue one foote in the Court, and another in the Church; and in ſuch manner build their Citie and frame their Policie, as the Ape did, in the Fable of <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes;</hi> which I will briefly recite, that all men may behold the picture, or image of their fooliſhnes who frame new Policies.</p>
                  <p>There was an old APE,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Hermogenes his Ape.</note> that had long time liued amongſt men; which at length, being negligently look't vnto, made an eſcape, and returned vnto the other Apes, into the woods and plaines. There ſhe declareth, that the life of men was very happie and bleſſed, who were guarded, with houſes againſt raine, cold and heate, and with walles againſt wilde beaſts and enemies: ſhe ſheweth alſo the corne ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp in their granaries, their aſſemblies and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, their theaters, their ſights, their playes. She exhorteth the reſt of the Apes, to imitate this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Men, to build houſes, and to compaſſe them in with walles, to keepe away other wilde beaſts. Whole troupes of Apes are met together, to heare this new Counſell. All of them applaud ſuch a ſpecious and profitable ſentence: and preſently the Senate and People of the Apes did publiſh a Decree, that foorthwith they ſhould begin to build a Citie. But the yonger Apes being ſent to prouide and fetch in timber and ſtones, when they wanted
<pb facs="tcp:177506:5"/>inſtruments, and had no meanes, to hew downe trees, to poliſh and fit the ſtones; at laſt they learne by experience, and acknowledge, that fooliſhly they attempted a thing impoſſible, and abhorrent from their nature.</p>
                  <p>Such altogether, are all thoſe Builders of new Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who dreame of new Policies, and a new Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. And albeit it bee credible, that in all Ages there were ſome ſuch Apes: yet our Age (alas for pitie!) hath ſeene very many, who haue been the cauſe, of great perturbation in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and of horrible ataxie in the Church, and now for a great time haue troubled all England. But let the wiſer and godlier ſort remember the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept deliuered in this Fable, and let them not raſhly and inconſideratly contend againſt Politique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, which doe not containe manifeſt impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or turpitude. I would haue ſpoken more to this purpoſe (Right Reuerend and moſt worthie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop) but that I did know your Lordſhips Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Learning to be ſuch, that you doe farre better vnderſtand theſe things, than they can bee ſpoken by me.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit in this moſt exulcerate and diſtreſſed age of the world, the Church of God hath been long encombred with needleſſe Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about THINGS INDIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERENT, or Eccleſiaſticall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; wherein ſome haue labored for retaining and obſeruing ALL manner of Traditions, without difference,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">All Tra diti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not to be reiected.</note> and others againe for reiecting and deſpiſing ALL without any ſcruple or regard: Yet had I rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to their aſſertion, who, ſayling as it were in the wide Ocean of humane opinions, take the middle courſe or line, going directly betweene both the two former Rockes; that is, of ſuch, who neither refuſe ALL, nor yet retaine ALL, without due regard, examination and triall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For it is the part of Chriſtian diſcretion and wiſdome, to obſerue the Rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Trie</hi> ALL <hi>things, keepe that which is</hi> GOOD, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4, 21.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Seeing the Apoſtle willeth vs, to TRIE ALL things, doubtleſſe he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that ALL things, are not, either to be reiected, or to be receiued; but rather wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177506:8"/>to be examined and tried. And ſeeing he counſelleth vs, to KEEPE <hi>that which is</hi> GOOD, he ſufficiently admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, to beware, that we embrace not thoſe things which are EVILL, neither deſpiſe thoſe which are GOOD; ſince thot both theſe argue a man, to be either of very weake iudgement, or altogether irreligious, ſuch as Chriſtians cannot be, without great offence and reproach.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Now vnder the word ALL, are alſo comprehended Traditions: wherefore ſeeing the Apoſtle ſpeakes general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, TRIE ALL THINGS, they alſo ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from triall.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Let Traditions therefore be tried and examined with competent diſcretion after the Rule of GODS truth,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Traditions ought to be tried.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the euill may be diſcerned from the good; and whereby thoſe things which we ought to obſerue, may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and thoſe which we ought to reiect, may be reiected.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 But it is eaſily propounded generally, that ſuch Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are to be obſerued, which are good, profitable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; and ſuch alſo to be reiected and refuſed, which are euill, hurtfull, pernicious. But when we are particularly to declare, what Traditions be good and indifferent, this thing is not ſo eaſilie determined.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Wherefore, that both Truth and Falſehood may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare herein; and that godly, religious and ſober men may vnderſtand and know, out of GODS word, what they ought to follow, and what to auoid in this buſines; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that we proſecute this point ſomewhat more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Hereupon I thought it would be anſwerable vnto my labour, and counteruaile my trauell, if that I ſhould repeate the whole doctrine of THINGS INDIFFERENT metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically handled, and ſhould lay it open before all mens eyes, to behold the ſame, and to iudge thereof.</p>

                        <p n="25">25 Now euery Gouernment doth require Miniſters and maintenance.

                        <p n="26">26 To this buſineſſe there doth neede many fellowes and Miniſters, who cannot liue without maintenance and ſtipends: alſo it is needfull that Biſhops haue ſome ſtore of liuing, whereby they may be enabled to beſtow and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe neceſſarie charges in Gouernment.</p>

                     <p n="24">24 <hi>Ezechias</hi> had no EXPRESSE Word of GOD, for the taking away of the brazen Serpent, and yet it pleaſed God: becauſe the Generall kind of that particular fact, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, to wit, to take away all Idolatrie, and the occaſions thereof.

                     <p n="25">25 But if the <hi>Regenerate</hi> be as yet <hi>Weake in faith:</hi> that is, If they do vſe any of theſe Indifferent things to the ſcandal, either of themſelues, or of any other, then are they vnto them <hi>Vnlawfull,</hi> as is manifeſt.</p>

                     <p n="27">27 Now then, it remaineth that we expreſſe a certaine Canon or RVLE whereby we may aſſuredly know what Things are INDIFFERENT vnto vs, and what are not: and the RVLE is this.</p>
                     <p n="28">28 If theſe Traditions, on the one ſide,

                     <p n="29">29 The Reaſon of this Rule or Canon, is becauſe all the <hi>Traditions of the Apostles,</hi> had theſe two things, <hi>First,</hi> They had Grounds from the Scriptures; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Profit to the furtherance and helpe of publique piety and edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="30">30 And this is manifeſted by two arguments. <hi>First,</hi> out of the general Rule which the Apoſtle preſcribeth for theſe matters (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) <hi>Let all thingi be done to edification:</hi> and againe, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in good order. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> by a particular Induction of thoſe places, wherein we reade the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, whereof I haue thought good to expreſſe ſome Examples.</p>
                     <p n="31">31 (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) The Apoſtle ordaineth, that Women ſhould pray in the Church couered, and Men bare-headed. <hi>First of all,</hi> this is not repugnant to holy Scriptures. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the end of this Conſtitution, is honeſtie, the preſeruation of Decency, and the edification of the Church; that is to ſay, that the outward Worſhip may be performed with greater honeſty and comlineſſe. <hi>Againe,</hi> Another End of that Ceremonie, is, that thereby euery one might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and put in mind of his owne place and dutie; namely that the Man is the head of the Woman: and the Woman was put in mind of her ſubiection to the Man: which things are profitable to the Internall Worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="32">32 In the ſame place; the Apoſtle ſetteth downe an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the due celebration of the Lords Supper, that all of them ſhould meete and aſſemble together, and tarry one for another. <hi>First,</hi> he ſheweth that this ought to be done out of the Word of God, that is, out of the Inſtitution of Chriſt himſelfe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The End hereof, is their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177506:21"/>leaſt they ſhould be guiltie of the body and blood of Chriſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the ſame holy Supper might be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated with greater reuerence. <hi>Lastly,</hi> that this outward Ceremony of meeting and aſſembling together, might ſerue to the inward Worſhip, namely to faith, charity, and the ſpirituall vnion of the minds, or ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="33">33 (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) He ordaineth, how Tongues may be vſed in the Church; to wit, that no man ſpeake in a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, without interpretation and explication. <hi>First,</hi> How many reaſons doth the Apoſtle vſe, drawen out of the holy Scriptures, to proue this ordinance, to be according vnto will of God, to be good and honeſt? After many Reaſons vſed to that purpoſe, at laſt he bringeth the authoritie of ſacred Writ; ſaying, <hi>It is written in the Law, I will ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this</hi> (vnbeleeuing) <hi>people in diuers tongues, and with ſtrange lippes, that ſo they may not heare me:</hi> as if the Apoſtle had ſaid in other words, Suffer not theſe men, to ſpeake ſtraunge tongues in your congregation, without explication; for this were a ſigne that God loueth you not, for he is wont to ſend ſuch Prophets to the vnbeleeuing Nations, whom he would not haue to know his will, or to attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he plainly affirmeth, that the End of this conſtitution, is the edification of the Church, that they might haue conſolation, exhortation, inſtruction, &amp;c. that is, that it might ſerue the inward Worſhip, faith, loue and conſolation of Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="34">34 The ſelfe ſame thing may be ſaid of all other Canons, Conſtitutions and Ordinances of the Apoſtles, all which, it were very tedious to repeate in this place. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They haue their foundation in the Word of God, or elſe they doe not repugne the ſame. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſerue to aduance pietie, to ſtirre vp repentance and faith: and finally, they ſerue to the end, that the godly in the Church, may with greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and more fruite, heare the Word of God, receiue the Sacraments, beleeue his promiſes, and obſerue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements all their whole life.</p>
                     <p n="35">35 Out of theſe things, which hitherto wee haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177506:22"/>theſe Concluſions following, doe manifeſtly follow.</p>

And before they can bee brought to beare theſe things, their Conſciences ought not to bee troubled, neither ought any man to reaſon with them contentiouſly, racking and ſnatching their words, ſayings or actions, vnto the worſer part: but their weaknes is to bee tendred, and cured by little and little, ſeeing they doe not ſinne of malice, nor haue any purpoſe to defend their errors ſtubbornely, but are docible, albeit they are not as yet confirmed and ſetled in iudgement.</p>

                     <p n="104">104 So alſo, the direct and proper End of the Prelats and Paſtors Eccleſiaſticall, is that they may edifie, gouerne, informe, and teach by the Word of God, the Conſciences of the Citizens of the Church; to wit, as they are heires of the kingdome of heauen, and are, at one time or other, to be gathered thither, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.2.3.</p>
                     <p n="105">105 Whereupon the Eccleſiaſtical power, is termed; <hi>Ius Poli,</hi> the Law of Heauen: and the Ciuill, <hi>Ius Soli,</hi> the Law of Earth.</p>

                     <p n="9">9 Of the Former, Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto <hi>Peter (Matth.</hi> 16.23.) <hi>Go behind me Satan, thou art a Scandall,</hi> or an offence <hi>vnto me.</hi> For albeit indeed, Chriſt was not ſcandalized, yet it was not long of <hi>Peter,</hi> but that Chriſt being terrified with the cogitation of the Croſſe, did breake the courſe of his vocation: and the ſaying of <hi>Peter</hi> did verily grieue him; and, vnto the weake, might haue been an occaſion of ruine.</p>

                     <p n="12">12 Of the Latter kind, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13.) For S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not, that any man ſhould, either vſe Things indifferent, or abſtaine from the vſe of them, with the offence of his Neighbour.</p>

                     <p>HItherto, beloued Brethren, haue we handled thoſe things which ſeemed to appertaine vnto the true and lawfull vſe of Things indifferent, that ſo we might more throughly vnderſtand the Nature thereof. Wherein, I preſume, I haue fully ſatisfied ALL SVCH as are Chriſtianly affected, who truly walke according vnto the Spirit, and yeeld vnto the Truth, embracing the ſame ſimplie, ſincerely and conſtantly: In ſo much that in this Controuerſie, I dare vndergoe the cenſure and iudgement of all the Learned and good men throughout the whole world; who (I hope) will allow of this my counſell; and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie perceiue, that I haue not diſputed concerning theſe ſo important matters, with other mens affections, nor with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſire of attaining the fauour of any man, nor with the endeuor of diſſenting from others, nor for the loue of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, nor of pertinacious obſtinacie, nor yet of any other euill and inordinate affection or deſire: but that I haue, to my poore abilitie, ſerued the neceſſitie of the Church. For when I had vnderſtood, that in the firſt Viſitation of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:177506:51"/>Right reuerend father in God, the L. BISHOP OF LONDON, there were many diſſonant clamours of vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, contending about many things, ſpecially about Eccleſiaſticall Rites and Ceremonies; I haue gathered the Summe of the Doctrine concerning THINGS INDIFFERENT, deliuered by <hi>Caluin, Melancthon, Bucer, Zanchius, Vrſinus, Beza,</hi> and other learned and approued Diuines, in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Volumes of Comentaries, Sermons and other Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctats, as it were into one Body, whereby any man might plainly ſee at the firſt bluſh, as in a Table, what is to be held, and what to be auoyded, in this whole buſines. And I will that Writing to be vnderſtood rightly and ingenuouſly, without cauilling, without calumniations.</p>
                     <p>It is certaine, that in this ſo great infirmitie of men,

Hereupon ſome men moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly ſinne, both againſt themſelues, and againſt the reſt of their Brethren, who are contentious and turbulent for euery little moale or blemiſh, &amp; ſo trouble both their owne and other mens conſciences, as if all Chriſtianitie were in danger to be loſt and wholly ouerthrowne. Neither doe I ſpeake this, as if I thought that any corruption ought to be winkt at and tolerated (Nay rather, let the Earth ſwallow me vp, or the Sea ſtop my breath, before that I defend any corruption of the celeſtiall Doctrine, or contend with the Church of God, wherein I deſire, as in an eternall Schoole after this life, to ſee and behold the Sonne of God, the Patriarkes, Prophets and Apoſtles, and to enioy their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and familiaritie:) but becauſe I iudge that thoſe things, that are to be pardoned and yeelded vnto Chriſtian
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:177506:52"/>charitie, are wiſely to be diſtinguiſhed, from ſuch as be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable and wicked; and that by the wiſedome, not of the fleſh, but of the ſpirit. And verily it is not a ſmall impietie, to imagine, that the whole vertue of Religion is placed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in contemning, or in obſeruing onely Ceremonies: ſeeing all learned men, who vnderſtand of our diſſentions and iarres, ſmile in their boſomes, and account it great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to be much troubled of either ſide concerning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, my reuerend and beloued Brethren. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pray and beſeech you, euen for His ſake, whoſe Glorie it is meete ſhould bee preferred before all other things whatſoeuer without exception; that you would vouchſafe to conuert all your endeuours and ſtudies to this end ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that there may be ſome fit remedie ſpeedily proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt that ſo great miſchiefe, that breedeth all this vnkindnes amongſt vs. Alas! We haue Aduerſaries enough abroad, againſt whom the Sonne of God commandeth that we maintaine vnitie and concord. But we contrariwiſe, ceaſe not euen to eate vp our owne ſhoulders and armes: and the frame of our Church being ſhrewdly ſhaken, our whole building threatneth downfall. Euen as in times paſt, whileſt <hi>Euſebius Biſhop of Ceſarea</hi> and <hi>Baſil the Great</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended amongſt themſelues, the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie took deep roote, and was diſperſed farre and neere: ſo at this day, whileſt the members of the true Church doe mutually warre the one againſt the other, we doe not onely ceaſe to be a terror vnto our common Enemies, but alſo for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable petulancie and pride, in coyning new opinions, and diſperſing the ſame abroad with all impunitie, to the greateſt Scandal of all Churches, againſt the ancient ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Sanctions, and the moſt ſtrict and ſeuere prohibitions of our owne Lawes, we are publiquely expoſed to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſcorne of all men. We hope, Brethren, that you are not ſo ignorant of all things, that you know not the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others concerning theſe our controuerſies; nor ſo without common ſenſe, that you alone doe not ſee our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:177506:52"/>dangers: nor yet ſo inhumane and cruell, that you are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing affected with thoſe miſeries which wee feele and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine. You know that the common Enemies of the Church of England will become more terrible and fearefull vnto vs, if they ſhall ſet vpon our Church being tired and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with inteſtine hatred and contentions: neither are you ignorant, that domeſtique Diſtentions haue alwaies been a very mortal and deadly bane euen vnto great Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. How much better therefore is it, that you bend all your forces to this, that you may comfort and cheriſh our afflicted Church, as much as ſafely you may, and prouide that the ſincere Doctrine of all neceſſarie things being faithfully taught, may bee propagated vnto all poſteritie. Vnto which dutie, firſt of all your pietie and deuotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD, vnto whom we wholly owe whatſoeuer we are, ought to excite and prouoke you: Then your Zeale to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the holy faith and religion, and the conſcience of your Vocation and calling, ought ſpecially to inflame you: That I ſpeake nothing, what your obedience towards the Kings Maieſtie and other Magiſtrates requireth; what the ſtate of the Church of England (your own louing Mother) which now ſeemeth to be ſicke of a conſumption, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth at your hands; and laſtly, what your dutie towards your Country, parents, children, kindred, friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, doth expoſtulate: All which being put together, ought more than ſufficiently, not onely to moue and excite you, but alſo to force and compell you, that by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon helpe and meanes theſe Domeſtique fires be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſhed. Oh, thinke with your ſelues, and conſider diligently and ſeriouſly, how much honeſter is your godly ſubmiſſion and conformitie in Things indifferent, than is your ſuperſtitious pride and arrogancie in forſaking your Churches!</p>
                     <p>But if vnder pretenſe of puritie, and the Goſpell, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſtill to indulge and ſerue your owne partiall affections (which GOD gratiouſly forbid) yet in theſe ſo great diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and diſtractions of mindes and men, the Godly

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:177506:56"/>like the Papacie as is poſſible, diſdaining euen the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall practiſe and diſcipline of the Primitiue Church, leſt they ſhould ſeeme in any thing to be imitators of them, whom they ſo much abhorred. The one loſing their gamme by ſhort-ſhooting; and the other by ouer-ſhooting. Finally, the one being the very plague and bane, and the other the diſgrace and ſhame of Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Incredible haue bin the practiſes of both ſorts, for the aduantaging and aduancing either of them their owne part. The former, like a cruell Tygre, or ſauage Beare, haue not ceaſed from continuall plotting of bloodie deſignements, to accompliſh their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous intendment: and the later, like a wily Foxe, creeping into the boſome of their fauourers, vnder pretenſe of farther reformation, haue laboured to raiſe iealouſie and ſuſpition againſt the Kings ſacred Maieſtie, and the reuerend Gouernours of our Church, wherby, ſetting all States by the eares, they might the more eaſily bring in their deformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, and anarchicall ataxie. But the more the waues and billowes beate againſt the rock, the more are they broken, and turne into a vaine foame or froath, and yet the rocke neuer the weaker: ſo the more the malice of our Aduerſaries, on both ſides, rageth againſt vs, our rocke is impregnable, hurt themſelues they may, but cannot harme vs.</p>

                              <p n="1">I.

<note place="margin" type="runSum">Of Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miniſters</note> that a faithfull Minitier of Chriſt ought not onely to know the will of God but alſo to do thereafter.

For my owne part, I can ſay no more of ſuch Miniſters, than what Chriſt ſaith of the Scribes and Phariſies, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2.3.) <hi>They ſit in Moſes chaire: All therefore whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue, that obſerue and doe; but after their works do not; for they ſay and do not.</hi> It ought to content vs, that they teach true doctrine; and that they liue not thereafter, it hurteth not me, for they ſhall carrie their owne burdens. The doctrine is ours; the life is theirs: let vs take the doctrine, and leaue the manners. I had rather haue a ſincere Preacher of Gods Word, that will declare Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me purely, rebuke my ſinful liuing, comfort me with the ſweete promiſes of the Goſpell, ſhew me how I ought to frame my life according to the will of God, &amp;c. albeit his manners be ſomewhat corrupt, and diſſent from his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; then to haue a wicked Heretique, a peſtilent Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or a ſuperſtitious Hypocrite, who outwardly ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a certaine grauitie, and a pure manner of liuing, and yet corrupt the holy Scriptures, leade the people into ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious errors, ſlatter the hearers, preach for lucre, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the doctrine of Chriſt, and obſcure the way of truth.

It is very lamentable indeed, that the doctrine of truth is not heard with more fruit; yet do they offend, who looke for pure aſſemblies in earth, without ſpot or blemiſh. Chriſt compareth the Goſpell vnto a net, that containeth fiſh and filth: and the Lords field hath in it both good corne and tares; which yet muſt not be weeded out, vntill harueſt be come. Vainely therefore doe they labour to ſeeke pure aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; albeit if they would looke into their owne ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it may be they might finde therein as many Sinners as are in ours. But theſe men ought to content themſelues, as the godly haue euer done, that the wicked being knowne cannot hurt the ſaithfull; who either haue no auctoritie to curbe them, or cannot otherwiſe prouide for publique peace, then by tolerating ſuch. And yet there want not in the meane time publique Lawes and penalties to reſtraine and bridle ſuch as be notorious offenders.</p>
                              <p>That which they ſpeake concerning the <hi>Communion,</hi>

Chriſt celebrated his Supper with his weake Diſciples, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Iudas</hi> to be partaker thereof, as many excellent Diuines do hold. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſely commandeth, that euery man <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelfe.</hi> It is my dutie to looke vnto my ſelfe, and thine vnto thy ſelfe, &amp; of euery other vnto himſelfe. So that a faithfull Miniſter ſeemeth to haue ſufficiently diſcharged his dutie, if he ſhall diligently admoniſh the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants hereof, and not curiouſly prie into the ſecrets of other men. Concerning manifeſt crimes the Church hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Lawes of admonition, of Counſell, &amp;c. If any liſt to communicate contemning theſe; I ſee not how any man may exclued thoſe from the Communion, whom God the Father, and Chriſt Ieſus admit their ghueſts: neither doeſt thou know what God may worke in a Sinner, euen in that

                              <p>Yet I can but wonder at the giddines of the Defenders Spirit, where he ſeemeth expreſſely to deny what heere he confeſſeth. <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I affirme that all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall acts and Sentences (how many ſoeuer of depriuation of Ministers, from their Benefices) had, made and giuen, by the Eccleſiasticall Iudges, ſince the</hi> 25. <hi>of King</hi> Henry the 8. <hi>only according, or only by force, and vertue of the ſaid</hi> Ius Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, <hi>or Biſhop of Rome his Law, (the Sentences giuen in the time of</hi> Queene Mary <hi>excepted) are, and ought to be holden, not to be had, made and giuen, by the Lawes of this Kingdome, or by the Kings Eccleſiasticall Law.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:177506:87"/>ſeeth, except his eyes deceiue him. II. The Depriuation of the refractarie Miniſters, for non-conformitie is grounded, not vpon the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, but vpon the expreſſe words of the Statute (<hi>of</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2.)
<q>All and ſingular Archbiſhops and Biſhops &amp;c. ſhall haue full power and auctoritie by vertue of this Act &amp;c. to puniſh by admonition, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, ſequeſtration, or DEPRIVATION, &amp;c.</q> III. It is not true that the <hi>Canon</hi> Law was euery yet,

Notwithstanding, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere your question, though it cannot be denied, that for other ſinnes the Lord hath ſo heauily ſcourged vs, yet why ſhould the ſuppreſſing of the Ministerie of the Goſpell be excluded?</hi>
                        </p>

All your clamour was raiſed only vpon the Correctors miſtaking. The words in the written coppie (which yet is to bee ſhewed) are theſe. <hi>They mistake the End; as thoſe Gentiles did the Efficient, who affirmed they were plagued, becauſe of the Christians contempt of their Gods.</hi> You take all the aduantage you can, and allow vs no time to Anſwere your LIBELS. The Auctor divulged his <hi>Supplication,</hi> euen almoſt in the latter end of the laſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Parliament, and I had not aboue foure or fiue daies to write the <hi>Conſideration;</hi> which I was compelled, through the ſtraightnes of time, to commit vnto the preſſe, as faſt as I could write it: wherefore I could not intend to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it my ſelfe; which was the cauſe aſwell of this error you exclaime againſt, as alſo of breaking the <hi>Series</hi> of the Alphabet, in the Marginall gloſſes of this 17. <hi>Arg.</hi> and of ſome other typographicall eſcapes.

                        <p>But to returne to your Replie. I ſay againe, that the END wherefore the Lord doth correct vs, is not the <hi>Restoring of

                              <p>AND thus haue I encountered with IGNORANCE it ſelfe, ioyned with extreame MALICE, paſſions wherewith the Defender ſeemeth to be notoriouſly qualified. Firſt, his IGNORANCE is palpable, in that he hath neither Arte to diſpute, nor Stile to diſcourſe, nor Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to diſcerne ſuch matters as he handleth: al which are euidently confirmed, I. By his immethodicall and euil-featured thapſodie, being full of vaine tautologies, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with much friuolous and idle talke, as it were of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcraſied braine, leſt his Booke (forſooth) might be termed a TRIOBOLAR PAMPHLET, or a TVVO-LEAVED LIBELL, as himſelfe ſeemeth to confeſſe (<hi>pag.</hi> 17.) II. By his ſenſeleſſe Periods, and groſſe Soleciſmes euen in the Engliſh tongue: as (<hi>pag.</hi> 38) <hi>The Auctor is able to defend his meaning, or ready to yeeld better reaſon</hi> TO THE CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRARIE; alſo (<hi>pag.</hi> 46.) <hi>The Cauſe why wee are put out, is not</hi> FOR RESPECT <hi>of our ſelues, but</hi> FOR FEARE <hi>of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against God;</hi> and (<hi>pag.</hi> 58) <hi>Except you meane</hi> NOT <hi>the cauſe of the Ministers;</hi> and (<hi>pag.</hi> 150.) <hi>Let the contrarietie of the Anſwerer, to almost</hi> IN <hi>his whole Anſwere written, be obſerued, &amp;c.</hi> III.

                              <p>Secondly, his MALICE is apparent in euery page, yea almoſt in euery line of his <hi>Defence,</hi> wherein hee ſcorneth, and reproacheth, and ſlaundereth, not only my poore ſelfe (whom he extreamely hateth for no other cauſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not of his faction) but alſo all the reuerend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats and Magiſtrates of this Land, yea the whole Church of God amongſt vs, as we haue heard alreadie.</p>

                              <p>When I had firſt peruſed ouer this vile and diſgracefull Libell, I could but maruel at the impudencie of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in ſo learned an age, durſt preſume to publiſh ſo fillie a worke: Whereupon I purpoſed to haue paſſed it ouer with ſilence, as diſdaining to accept ſo Ignorant a Man for my Antagoniſt, and to encounter with ſuch, as with an Aduerſarie, whom it were fitter to inſtruct, as a Schoole-boy. But when I had better conſidered the humor of the refractarie faction, who embrace euery Sentence proceeding from their RABBINES, as an ORACLE, be it neuer ſo abſurd; and perceiued the Booke it ſelfe, to bee preiudiciall to his Maieſties auctoritie and Lawes, to the peace of GODS Church, and propagation of the Goſpell, I was perſwaded (for this once) to take a litle labour to ſhew the Defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders folly in his weaker <hi>Defence</hi> of ſo weake <hi>Arguments;</hi> which I haue done as briefely as I could: for why ſhould I ſpeake much of a Diſcourſe ſo little worth?</p>
                              <p>And heere I openly teſtifie, and plainely profeſſe, both vnto the Defender, and to all others of his ſtraine; that if hereafter any of them ſhall ſet vpon, or attempt any thing againſt any Booke or Writing of mine; if they ſhall doe it in the common Idiome of the Engliſh, I will paſſe it ouer with ſilence, and not vouchſafe them any Anſwere: and this, 1. Becauſe it is not fit and conuenient that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, being moued only amongſt Scholers, and no way concerning the Lay-people, ſhould be vulgarly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to the increaſe of factions and part-takings in the Church. 2. Becauſe that, hauing other imployments more neceſſarie for theſe times, by this meanes I ſhall be free from being troubled with the tedious prating, the clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſcornefull gybing of euery DVNSE, that can but chatte Engliſh.</p>
                              <p>Wherefore I require and adiure you (my reuerend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) as you tender the quietnes of the Church, yea and your owne honeſt reputation, that hereafter (if you be not yet ſatisfied) you will write in the LATINE tongue, which is the tongue of the Learned, and not in the ENGLISH, to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:177506:102"/>fill the Common-peoples heads with idle and vaine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: Which reaſonable requeſt, if you ſhall refuſe to yeeld vnto, ſurely it will be thought that all you do, is but <hi>ad faciendum populum,</hi> and alſo that you are but ignorant and vnlearned men, not able to write in Latine, as indeed all the DISCIPLINARIANS in Engliſh are reported to be: I ſpeake not this of all that ſtand out for the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, among whom there are ſome whom I reuerence for their gifts; but of the giddie <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> ſuch as this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Defender</hi> is, who could bee contented theſe twelue monethes, to ſuffer my Booke <hi>De Adiaphoris,</hi> to paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered, becauſe it was written in Latine, but no ſooner came there any thing vnder my name in Engliſh, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he ſet vpon it, according vnto the Prouerb, <hi>Who more bold, then blind Bayard?</hi>

                              <p>The Lord heale the wounds of his Church, appeaſe this inteſtine diſſention among Brethren, and grant that wee may do all things to the glory of his holy Name.</p>
